I only speak English, you can translate if you want.

All strings that need to be translated are indicated with the
_() macro. So to do the strings, change internat.hh to define 
this macro correctly, and translate the strings creating a .po file.

I have used the "C" locale for regular expression searching. I
am not sure this is correct.
    imbue(std::locale::classic());

In any case wchar_t must be a UCS-4 character for at least regular
expression parsing! This disqualifies any system where sizeof(whcar_t) == 2
